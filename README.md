# -Disting-NT-Plugin--Los-Platos
Los Platos ("The Dishes") is a physical modeling cymbal synthesizer using **true modal synthesis** based on spectral analysis of real cymbals. Each cymbal type uses measured modal frequencies with individual decay rates per mode, resulting in authentic cymbal behavior.
